# Welcome! This projects title is Healthy Hearts Recipe APP

## This App provides various Recipe options, that are considered to be healthy alternatives. The technologies used are React and CSS. Some of the challenges I faced during the build of this project were, sizing the images in the Family Recipe page, getting the log in page to work, and problems with the ports with the front end and backend. Features I would like to implement in the future include a search button on the Sample Recipe page that would allow users to find recipes based on the keyword typed, or allergies they may have, also the nutrition information
### To use this app the user will first login, giving their name and password, next they can hover over any of the links in the nav bar, and upon clicking their choice a new page will open up where they can find various recipes to choose from. There is a logout button that returns the user to the home page
#### In the making of this project, I used a plethora of rescources provided in class from our instructor Dylan including, class lecture information and slides, resource class code along repos, various web sites such as Geeks for Geeks, MDN, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/, Landon Schlagen YouTube Video, Web Dev YouTube video, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-multi-page-website-using-react-js/, and various other sources are listed in comments of this project. Hope you enjoy, thank you for checking out this project!
